Norsk Bokmål Language Module for glossaries Package

This adds Norwegian Bokmål translations for the glossaries package, and will
automatically be loaded when the document/babel-package has the option `norsk`.

The package this is based on (glossaries-nynorsk), adds the same translations
for Norsk Nynorsk. That package will be loaded when the `nynorsk` option is
used as mentioned before.
